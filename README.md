# Resu-Maker
A quick and easy to use repository to maintain a resume and generate a polished pdf version

1. Fork the repository
2. Change it to be private (if you so choose)
3. Clone the repository to your machine
4. Edit the files under snippets/src/`, make sure to maintain the filenames as they are.
You *can* add new files, just maintain the numbering scheme
5. Commit changes and push
6. Upon `git push`, a workflow will execute to generate the pdf as a workflow artifact.

Thank you for your interest!
